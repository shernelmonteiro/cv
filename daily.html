                Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may by His Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of His Resurrection,

            I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
            Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
            He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
            He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
            I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.Amen

            Dear God in heaven, I come to you in the name of your Son Jesus Christ.
            I agree with your word , the bible, that I am a sinner who deserves to be punished for my sins.
            I have lived my life selfishly and independently of you, and according I deserve to spend eternity in hell. But I believe
            That you so loved me that you sent your Son Jesus Christ to pay for my sin. I come to you just as I am and call upon you to save me now.

            Dear lord Jesus, I believe that you care Almighty god who became man and died for me on the cross, and that you rose again from the dead on the third day
            To be my personal Savior. Forgive me for every sin and cleanse me with your precious and holy blood.
            I turn away from my sinful and useless way to living and I now open the door of my heart to you. Please come into my life, Lord Jesus, as my
            Savior, Master and God.
            I will follow you all the days of my life. Thank you for dying for me. Thank you for forgiving all my sins and saving me. Thank you got making me your son/daughter.
            Keep me safe from the evil one, and when life’s journey is over, take me to be with you in Heaven. Thank you, Lord, Amen.
